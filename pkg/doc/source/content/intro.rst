``PyEPO`` (PyTorch-based End-to-End Predict-then-Optimize) is a Python-based, open-source software package that supports modeling and solving linear and integer predict-then-optimize problems.

A core capability of ``PyEPO`` is to build your optimization models with GurobiPy, Pyomo, or any other solvers and train with SPO+ loss or Black-Box optimizer with PyTorch.
