``spo`` (Smart Predict then Optimize) is a Python-based, open-source software package that supports modeling and solving predict-then-optimize problems.

A core capability of ``spo`` is to build your optimization models with GurobiPy, Pyomo, or any other solvers and train with SPO+ loss or Black-Box optimizer with PyTorch.
